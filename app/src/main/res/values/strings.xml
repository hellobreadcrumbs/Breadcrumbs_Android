    <string name="faq_question_2">What are POIs?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_2"> Inspired by the idea of Breadcrumbs, which is defined as a series of connected pieces of information, POIs are Points-of-Interest at specific locations of a place or attraction where users can scan the QR Code to learn more about them and even challenge themselves to quizzes!
                        \n\n
                        Users can also find out more information such as the trail they belong to, distance, directional compass as well as the challenge type. Discovered POIs will be marked with an orange starred ribbon.
                        \n\n

    <string name="faq_answer_9"> What\'s a game without some friendly competition? Battle it out with other players for a spot at the top of the Leaderboard. Leaderboard ranking will be based on 3 parameters:\n
                        • Number of POIs discovered\n
